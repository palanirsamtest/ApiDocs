        The IDs of the parent resource (project or framework) and Launchpad ID of the group, in the `parent_resource_id:group_lp_id` format, which then must be encoded into Base64.

        For example, if the `parent_resource_id` is `11955` and the `group_lp_id` is `yvqdNCtv8TeM47WQtzau`, you would encode `11955:yvqdNCtv8TeM47WQtzau` into Base64. The result is `MTE5NTU6eXZxZE5DdHY4VGVNNDdXUXR6YXU=`, which is the `id`.
