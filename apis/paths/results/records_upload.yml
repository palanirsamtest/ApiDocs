  summary: Upload records data
  description: |
    When uploading records, you need to specify column names, data types, and records data.

    Valid data types are `character`, `numeric`, `logical`, `date`, `time`, and `datetime`. For more information, see
    <a href="https://help.highbond.com/helpdocs/highbond/en-us/Default.htm#cshid=rm-data-types" target="_blank">Supported data types</a>.

    > **Caution â€”**
    Changing a column's data type can break workflows in HighBond that depend on the affected column, like visualizations, metrics, and triggers.

    <strong>Limitations:</strong>
    <ul>
    <li>You cannot upload records to <a href="https://help.highbond.com/helpdocs/highbond/en-us/Default.htm#cshid=rm-data-analytics" target="_blank">Projects tables</a>.</li>
    <li>Each table can contain a maximum of 100,000 records, 500 columns, and 256 characters per field, including blank characters.</li>
    <li>You cannot upload more than 100kbs of records nor make multiple requests simultaneously (<code>429</code> error). To upload more than 100kb of data, split your records into multiple, smaller requests that can be made in sequence.</li>
    <li>If the table contains a primary key field, the values in the field must be unique. This field is used to uniquely identify each record in the table.</li>
    </ul>
