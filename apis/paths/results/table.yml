    Permanently delete a table.

    > **Caution â€”**
    Deleting a table also permanently removes associated records, interpretations, metrics, and triggers.

    <strong>Limitations</strong>: Generally, you cannot delete tables that were created in HighBond to support the operation of another feature (for example, <a href="https://help.highbond.com/helpdocs/highbond/en-us/Default.htm#cshid=pm-certifications" target="_blank">Certifications</a> and <a href="https://help.highbond.com/helpdocs/highbond/en-us/Default.htm#cshid=pm-control-performance" target="_blank">Control Performance</a> generates their own data structures). You can delete these tables by deleting the project that generated them in the Projects app.
