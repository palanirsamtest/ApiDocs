  operationId: deleteProject
  summary: Delete a project
  description: |
    Delete a project that you no longer require. Projects in the state `"active"`, `"archived"` or `"delete"` can be deleted.

    You can temporarily or permanently delete a project:
    * By default, projects are temporarily deleted. The project is moved to a `"delete"` state and stored in the Project Library for 30 days. Project
    Admins receive an email notification when a project has been temporarily deleted. After 30 days, the project is permanently deleted automatically.
    * To request a permanent deletion of a project, you must specify `"delete"` using the `permanent` parameter. Project Admins do not receive
    an email notification when a project is permanently deleted.

    > **Caution â€”**
    Once a project is permanently deleted, you cannot access or restore the project.

    and restoring projects</a>.
