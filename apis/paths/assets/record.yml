  summary: Delete an asset record
  description: |
    Delete an asset record that you no longer require. Generally, unless an asset record was created in error, it's better to transition it through its normal life-cycle.

    > **Caution â€”**
    Once an asset record is permanently deleted, you cannot access or restore the asset record.
